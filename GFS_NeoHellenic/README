====================

The font GFSNeohellenicMath was commissioned to the Greek Font Society (GFS)
by the Graduate Studies program "Studies in Mathematics" of the Department
of Mathematics of the University of the Aegean, located on the Samos island, Greece.

The design copyright belongs to the main designer of GFS, George Matthiopoulos.
The OpenType Math Table embedded in the font was developed by the
Mathematics Professor Antonis Tsolomitis.

The font is released under the latest OFL license, and it is available
from the GFS site at http://www.greekfontsociety-gfs.gr

The font is an almost Sans Serif font and one of its main uses is for presentations,
an area where (we believe) a commercial grade sans math font was not available
up to now.

The font contains an extened glyph set including more than the standard math symbols such
as vertically extended integrals, chess symbols, etc. Vertically extended integrals
are useful for large constructions although they are still not accessible by unicode-math
(developement of this feature is in the works). To facilitate access to these symbols
a style file is included (gfsneohllenicot.sty). Larger integrals are accessible with the
commands \Bigint, \biggint, \Biggint, \bigggint. Smaller integrals, sums and products
are also available with the commands \smallprod, \smallcoprod, \smallsum and \smallint.

This style file does two additional things. First, it scales the font to 1.2 of it's design size
to match the xheight of GFSDidot if a serif font is needed to be used with it, and
fixes accordingly the interline skip. Second it modifies interword spacing to 75% 
for a tighter look, and adds interletter spacing (tracking) to the \scshape command.
Oldstyle numbers are also accessible with \scshape.

A math sample is bundled with the font courtesy of Alain Aubord who has converted
to LaTeX the work of Steve Seiden named "Theoretical Computer Science Cheat Sheet".
(The name was switched to "Mathematics Cheat Sheet" by Antonis Tsolomitis). 
(Note that Steve Seiden in his license allows redistribution not for profit
if his copyright is not altered (it appears on page 4 of the the cheat sheet)).

A Greek Math sample is available
at http://myria.math.aegean.gr/~atsol/newpage/lecturenotes/convex-geometry/cga.pdf

We want to thank Alain Aubord for providing the cheat sheet and for running several tests
with the font that provided important feedback.
