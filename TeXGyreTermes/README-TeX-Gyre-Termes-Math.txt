############          A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FONT          ############
###########################################################################

TeX Gyre Termes Math is a math companion for the TeX Gyre Termes family
of fonts (see http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/) in
the OpenType format.

The math OTF fonts should contain a special table, MATH, described in the 
confidential Microsoft document "The MATH table and OpenType Features 
for Math Processing". Moreover, they should contain a broad collection
of special characters (see "Draft Unicode Technical Report #25.
UNICODE SUPPORT FOR MATHEMATICS" by Barbara Beeton, Asmus Freytag,
and Murray Sargent III). In particular, math OTF scripts are expected
to contain the following scripts: a basic serif script (regular, bold, 
italic and bold italic), a calligraphic script (regular and bold), 
a double-struck script, a fraktur script (regular and bold), a sans-serif 
script (regular, bold, oblique and bold oblique), and a monospaced script.

The basic script is, obviously, TeX Gyre Termes. Symbols, namely,
calligraphic, double struck, Greek, sans serif bold Greek, and Hebrew,
were drawn from scratch. The main math component, that is, the math
extension, was also programmed from scratch.

Some scripts, however, are borrowed from other fonts (the current
selection, however, may be subject to change):

  * The fraktur alphabets (regular and bold) is excerpted
    from the Leipziger Fraktur replica by Peter Wiegel
    ( http://www.peter-wiegel.de/Leipzig.html )
    with the kind permission of the author.

  * The sans serif alphabets (regular, oblique, bold, and
    bold oblique) are excerpted from TeX Gyre Heros
    http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/heros
    (actually, the sans serif bold Greek symbols are based
    on TeX Gyre Heros Greek alphabet).

  * The monospaced alphabet is excerpted from TeX Gyre Cursor
    http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/cursor

Note that the members of all the mentioned alphabets, except
the main roman alphabet, should be considered symbols, not letters;
symbols are not expected to occur in a text stream; instead,
they are expected to appear lonely, perhaps with some embellishments
like subscripts, superscripts, primes, dots above and below, etc.

To produce the font, MetaType1 and the FontForge library were used:
the Type1 PostScript font containing all relevant characters was
generated with the MetaType1 engine, and the result was converted
into the OTF format with all the necessary data structures by
a Python script employing the FontForge library.

Recent changes (ver. 1.502 --> ver. 1.543) comprised
mainly interline settings in OTF tables (HHEA and
OS/2) and the correction of the unicode slots assigned to
contour integrals (glyphs `clockwise contour
integral', u+2232, and `anticlockwise contour
integral', u+2233, used to have swapped slots).

                   *    *    *

The TeX Gyre Math Project was launched and is supported by
TeX USERS GROUPS (CS TUG, DANTE eV, GUST, NTG, TUG India, TUG, UK TUG).
Hearty thanks to the representatives of these groups and also
to all people who helped with their work, comments, ideas,
remarks, bug reports, objections, hints, consolations, etc.
