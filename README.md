Description
-----------

This repository contains a script to fetch various open source OpenType fonts
with a MATH table as well as the corresponding fonts to use for the surrounding
text (if any). The fonts are converted into WOFF (with zopfli compression) and
WOFF2 formats using
[fonttools](https://github.com/behdad/fonttools), which may perform additional
optimizations. It is expected that all the transformations preserve
[Functional Equivalence](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL_web_fonts_and_RFNs#33301a9c)
and so Reserved Font Names remain unchanged. The fonts are finally
[packaged](https://github.com/fred-wang/MathFonts/archive/gh-pages.zip) with
some documentation, a license and a `mathfont.css` stylesheet, so that you can
easily use them on your Web site. Some proprietary fonts as well as incomplete
open source fonts are also listed but they are not provided.

Warning
-------

This page uses features that may not be supported by legacy web rendering engines:

- MathML and the OpenType MATH table.
- the WOFF2 format.
- CSS rules from the [CSS Fonts Module Level](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-fonts/)
  that are used by some fonts to provide old style numbers and
  calligraphic letters.

Using Math fonts on your Web site
---------------------------------

Download the
[zip archive](https://github.com/fred-wang/MathFonts/archive/gh-pages.zip).
Choose one family for your web site and place the corresponding subdirectory
somewhere.
Make your pages link to the `mathfonts.css` stylesheet. The MathML formulas
will then render with the specified font. It's good to make them consistent
with the surrounding text, especially for inline expressions. To do that,
use the `htmlmathparagraph` class, e.g. `<body class="htmlmathparagraph">`.
By default, the local fonts installed on the system will be used. For open
source fonts, Web fonts in WOFF2 or WOFF format will be used as a fallback.

Most families provide old style numbers in the text font. You can use them via
the `oldstylenumbers` class, e.g.
`<span class="oldstylenumbers">0123456789</span>`. Some of the math fonts also
provide calligraphic style for the script characters, that you can select
with the `calligraphic` class e.g.
`<math><mi mathvariant="script" class="calligraphic">A</mi></math>` or
equivalently `<math><mi class="calligraphic">ùíú</mi></math>`.

Build Instructions
------------------

You need [GNU Core Utilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities)
(or equivalent on UNIX systems) as well as `sed`, `grep`, `unzip`, `wget`,
[fonttools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools),
[zopfli](https://github.com/fonttools/py-zopfli) and
[brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli). Type the following command
to build the font directories:

    ./configure
    make

Use `make clean` to remove intermediary files and `make distclean` to remove
all the files that are not tracked on GitHub.
